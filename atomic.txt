# Course Title: Understanding Atomic Structures

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Atomic Structure

### Subheading: What is an Atom?
~~
An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of atoms.
~~

### Subheading: Basic Parts of an Atom
~~
1. **Protons**: Positively charged particles located in the nucleus.
2. **Neutrons**: Neutral particles that also reside in the nucleus.
3. **Electrons**: Negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in various energy levels.

Question: What is the charge of a neutron? <br>(a) Positive <br> (b) Negative <br> (c) Neutral <br> (d) Variable {c}


## Chapter 2: Atomic Models

### Subheading: Thomson's Plum Pudding Model
~~
J.J. Thomson proposed the plum pudding model, where the atom is composed of electrons scattered within a "soup" of positive charge, like plums within a pudding.
~~

### Subheading: Rutherford's Nuclear Model
~~
Ernest Rutherford conducted the famous gold foil experiment and concluded that atoms consist of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons.
~~

### Subheading: Bohr's Model of the Atom
~~
Niels Bohr proposed that electrons move in specific orbits around the nucleus and that energy is emitted or absorbed when an electron moves between orbits. The energy levels are quantized.
Math: \( E_n = - \frac{13.6}{n^2} \text{eV} \)

Where:
- \( E_n \) is the energy of the electron in the \( n \)-th orbit,
- \( n \) is the principal quantum number.

Question: Who proposed the plum pudding model? <br>(a) Bohr <br> (b) Rutherford <br> (c) Thomson <br> (d) Dalton {c}


## Chapter 3: Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom

### Subheading: Wave-Particle Duality
~~
Electrons exhibit both particle and wave-like behavior, as demonstrated by experiments such as the double-slit experiment. This is described by the wave-particle duality theory.
~~

### Subheading: Schrödinger Equation
~~
The quantum mechanical model of the atom is based on Schrödinger’s wave equation, which describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time.
Math: \( \hat{H} \Psi = E \Psi \)

Where:
- \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian operator,
- \( \Psi \) is the wave function,
- \( E \) is the energy of the system.
~~

### Subheading: Quantum Numbers
~~
There are four quantum numbers that describe the properties of atomic orbitals and the electrons in those orbitals:
1. **Principal quantum number \( n \)**: Describes the size of the orbital.
2. **Angular momentum quantum number \( l \)**: Describes the shape of the orbital.
3. **Magnetic quantum number \( m_l \)**: Describes the orientation of the orbital.
4. **Spin quantum number \( m_s \)**: Describes the spin of the electron.

Question: What does the principal quantum number represent? <br>(a) Orbital size <br> (b) Orbital shape <br> (c) Electron spin <br> (d) Orbital orientation {a}


## Chapter 4: Atomic Orbitals

### Subheading: Shapes of Orbitals
~~
The shape of an atomic orbital is determined by the angular momentum quantum number \( l \). For example:
- \( s \)-orbitals are spherical,
- \( p \)-orbitals are dumbbell-shaped,
- \( d \)-orbitals have more complex shapes.
~~

### Subheading: Electron Configurations
~~
Electron configurations describe the distribution of electrons among the various orbitals of an atom. For example, the electron configuration of carbon is \( 1s^2 2s^2 2p^2 \).
~~

### Subheading: Pauli Exclusion Principle
~~
The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. This means that each electron in an atom has a unique quantum state.
~~

Question: Which orbitals are spherical in shape? <br>(a) \( s \)-orbitals <br> (b) \( p \)-orbitals <br> (c) \( d \)-orbitals <br> (d) \( f \)-orbitals {a}


## Chapter 5: Atomic Interactions

### Subheading: Coulomb's Law
~~
Coulomb's law describes the force between two charged particles. The electrostatic force \( F \) between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) is given by:
Math: \( F = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \)

Where:
- \( F \) is the electrostatic force,
- \( k_e \) is Coulomb’s constant,
- \( r \) is the distance between the charges.
~~

### Subheading: Ionization Energy
~~
Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom. The higher the ionization energy, the more difficult it is to remove an electron.
~~
