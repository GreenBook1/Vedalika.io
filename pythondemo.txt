# Course Title: Understanding Thermodynamics

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Thermodynamics

### Subheading: What is Thermodynamics?
~~
Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and energy. It studies how these quantities are related and how energy is transferred in different forms.
~~

### Subheading: Basic Concepts of Thermodynamics
~~
1. **System**: A thermodynamic system is the part of the universe we are interested in studying.
2. **Surroundings**: Everything outside the system.
3. **Internal Energy**: The total energy contained within a system.
4. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: The change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system.

Question: What is the first law of thermodynamics? <br> (a) Energy can be created <br> (b) Energy can be destroyed <br> (c) Energy can neither be created nor destroyed <br> (d) None of the above {c}


## Chapter 2: Laws of Thermodynamics

### Subheading: Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
~~
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
~~

### Subheading: First Law of Thermodynamics
~~
The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of energy conservation:
Math: \( \Delta U = Q - W \)

Where:
- \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy,
- \( Q \) is the heat added to the system, and
- \( W \) is the work done by the system.
~~

### Subheading: Second Law of Thermodynamics
~~
The Second Law of Thermodynamics introduces the concept of entropy \( S \), and states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time.
Math: \( \Delta S \geq 0 \)

Where:
- \( \Delta S \) is the change in entropy.

Question: What does the second law of thermodynamics deal with? <br> (a) Conservation of energy <br> (b) Increase of entropy <br> (c) Decrease of energy <br> (d) Increase of work {b}


## Chapter 3: Heat Engines

### Subheading: Carnot Engine
~~
A Carnot engine is a theoretical engine that operates on the reversible Carnot cycle. It provides the maximum possible efficiency that a heat engine can achieve.
The efficiency of a Carnot engine is given by:
Math: \( \eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H} \)

Where:
- \( T_C \) is the temperature of the cold reservoir,
- \( T_H \) is the temperature of the hot reservoir.
~~

### Subheading: Heat Pumps
~~
Heat pumps transfer heat from a colder area to a warmer area. The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is given by:
Math: \( COP = \frac{Q_H}{W} \)

Where:
- \( Q_H \) is the heat transferred to the hot reservoir,
- \( W \) is the work input.

Question: What is the efficiency of a Carnot engine operating between \( T_C = 300K \) and \( T_H = 600K \)? <br> (a) 0.5 <br> (b) 0.25 <br> (c) 0.75 <br> (d) 1 {a}


## Chapter 4: Entropy

### Subheading: Definition of Entropy
~~
Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. The greater the disorder, the higher the entropy. The change in entropy is given by:
Math: \( \Delta S = \frac{Q_{rev}}{T} \)

Where:
- \( \Delta S \) is the change in entropy,
- \( Q_{rev} \) is the reversible heat transfer,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature.
~~

### Subheading: Entropy in Real-World Processes
~~
In real-world processes, entropy always increases. This is why natural processes are irreversible. Entropy also plays a key role in determining the direction of heat transfer.

## Chapter 5: Thermodynamic Processes

### Subheading: Isothermal Process
~~
In an isothermal process, the temperature of the system remains constant. The work done in an isothermal process is given by:
Math: \( W = nRT \ln \left( \frac{V_f}{V_i} \right) \)

Where:
- \( W \) is the work done,
- \( n \) is the number of moles of gas,
- \( R \) is the gas constant,
- \( T \) is the temperature,
- \( V_f \) and \( V_i \) are the final and initial volumes, respectively.
~~

### Subheading: Adiabatic Process
~~
In an adiabatic process, there is no heat exchange with the surroundings. The relation between pressure and volume in an adiabatic process is given by:
Math: \( PV^\gamma = \text{constant} \)

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure,
- \( V \) is the volume,
- \( \gamma \) is the heat capacity ratio.
